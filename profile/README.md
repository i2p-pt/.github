I2P Pluggable Transport - Streaming Version
===========================================

This is an I2P-based Pluggable Transport for Tor which conceals the
location of an unlisted Tor relay(A "Bridge") and it's client(presumably TBB)
from eachother and from most network observers.

This is a new piece of software and it might or might not be useful. I think it
will be, but I've been wrong before. It was created independently of the I2P project
by an I2P developer. It went through several revisions before this one, and many
of it's features and requirements went into other projects including I2P, it's
libraries, and new projects created to fulfill this purpose. An exhaustive list
of those projects will be added at a later date.
